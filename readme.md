# Nerdle Solver

The aim of this project is a fairly silly interactive solver for https://nerdlegame.com/classic/

To try the automatic solver, you can run it from here: https://tonybuk.github.io/NerdleSolver/

This is all performed in a self contained interactive webpage.  The idea is that the Nerdle Solver will generate a guess, you enter it into Nerdle itself, manually assign the colours back into the Nerdle Solver, and it will iterate guesses from there.

It goes without saying, this is 100% unaffiliated with Nerdle.  Currently it will only solve Nerdle Classic out of the box.  Adding support for Nerdle Pro isn't out of the question, but we'll see what the demand is.
